<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* This uper is for the TDD module.
* First, I must understand what is being asked.
* Examine the ReadMe and study the output.
* Review the problem solving framework.
* Decide how to proceed, based on the given information.
*	1. must build a small application with the given items/tax requirements
*	2. must build tests FIRST to test all possible applications of the program.
*	3. must consider what would need to be tested in order to fully test the application.
* Decide what outputs need to be shown in order to be successful.
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* ReadMe shows sales tax added into the output prices, and also totaled at the bottom, so must gear application in that direction.
* Review the OOP, OOD and TDD notes from courses/class and build design.
* What can be separated into its own class - printing, imported versus domestic? Exempt vs non-exempt?
* Interface for sales tax?
* Plan tests to capture all functionality
* 
*

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
* I built the basic plan in the main class and then refactored to try and separate concerns.
* I created more tests as I coded, trying to test the basic input output, pricing and tax calculations.
* I attempted to refactor this even more to get rid of the array, but could not figure out how to calculate the price a different way.
* In the end, I left it the way it was. It works, and it produces the correct output. It is scalable, but it is ugly.
*

<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
* I reflect that I just don't know enough yet to do this exercise the way TEKSystems wants me to. 
* I wish I could absorb data faster, but it is what it is.
* With more time I am sure I could fix this, but I don't have that kind of time during bootcamp.

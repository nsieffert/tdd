<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* This uper is for the TDD module.
* First, I must understand what is being asked.
* Examine the ReadMe and study the output.
* Review the problem solving framework.
* Decide how to proceed, based on the given information.
*	1. must build a small application with the given items/tax requirements
*	2. must build tests FIRST to test all possible applications of the program.
*	3. must consider what would need to be tested in order to fully test the application.
* Decide what outputs need to be shown in order to be successful.
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* ReadMe shows sales tax added into the output prices, and also totaled at the bottom, so must gear application in that direction.
* Review the OOP, OOD and TDD notes from courses/class and build design.
* What can be separated into its own class - printing, imported versus domestic? Exempt vs non-exempt?
* Interface for sales tax?
* Plan tests to capture all functionality

<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* This uper is for the TDD module.
* First, I must understand what is being asked.
* Examine the ReadMe and study the output.
* Review the problem solving framework.
* Decide how to proceed, based on the given information.
*	1. must build a small application with the given items/tax requirements
*	2. must build tests FIRST to test all possible applications of the program.
*	3. must consider what would need to be tested in order to fully test the application.
* Decide what outputs need to be shown in order to be successful.
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* ReadMe shows sales tax added into the output prices, and also totaled at the bottom, so must gear application in that direction.
* Review the OOP, OOD and TDD notes from courses/class and build design.
* What can be separated into its own class - printing, imported versus domestic? Exempt vs non-exempt?
* Interface for sales tax?
* Plan tests to capture all functionality
* 
*
*
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
* I built the basic plan in the main class and then refactored to try and separate concerns.
* I created more tests as I coded, trying to test the basic input output, pricing and tax calculations.
* I attempted to refactor this even more to get rid of the array, but could not figure out how to calculate the price a different way.
* I kept working at it and finally got it refactored to be a little more OOP oriented, though I am sure it's not perfect.
* Was able to create a lot more tests.
* Two of the items gave me real trouble and I had to employ different techniques to get them to work.
*
*
<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
* I reflect that I still don't know enough to really do this the way it should be done. 
* I am happy with the changes I was able to make, and I was happy I could get more tests created.
* I don't care for the one-off solutions I came up with for the two that were giving me trouble, but the solutions work.
* With more time I could probably determine a better solution that could be applied across the board.
